    <h3>Bio.</h3>
    <p> My name is Jacob Hartel. I was born and raised in Missouri. My father worked on missile computer systems in the Air Force in his 23 years of service. After he retired he designed and built automated car washes. They use control computers which basically use binary.
        Ever since I was 12 I would help him work on those car washes. Once I realized how simply they were ran it made me believe I could have a career in programming. I hope that my work will take me to a form of physical automation. However, I do hope that 
        it is more complicated and challenging than belts, dryers, pressure washers, and hydraulics. I have have had a tumultuous life but I now understand that the experienced gained thru that makes me more of an asset with a practical view of the world.
