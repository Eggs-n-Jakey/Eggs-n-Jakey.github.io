    <h3>Bio.</h3>
    <p> My name is Jacob Hartel. I was born and raised in Missouri. I am currently a student at Ozark Technical Community College. I plan to Transfer to Missouri State University in 2025. I am pursuing my degree in Software Development.I hope to Graduate in 2027 (sooner if possible)</p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I am a gamer for the most part. I enjoy fast paced fps games. I also enjoy some stratedgy as well. I am an avid cyclist I enjoy trails and road cycling. I have done a couple 100+ treks with friends and hope to do more in the future. I enjoy tech and tech accessories. It's an incredible time to be alive and I think the next 10-15 years will be the most exciting time for techies.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>I really want to move to either Chicago or Philladelphia and find a good job and make a new home for myself. Ideally I would like to consult mid sized companies on improving their IT infrastructure and help build them updated software. I am aware by proxy that many companies are decades behind. I believe that in the coming future AI/ML will only improve exponentially and any companies that are not apart of the revolution will suffer exponential loses. The good thing is that MOST of us are behind. It's easy to think that next year all jobs will be gone but that is only the big companies. There is simply not enough AI professionals. I hope that I can atleast gain enough knowledge to manage AI developers and middle man the deployment. Who knows, things happen and I could end up in a very different spot. I am atleast going in this direction to see what happens.</p>
